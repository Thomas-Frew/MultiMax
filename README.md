MultiMax is a [QuantConnect](https://www.quantconnect.com/) app that combines the insights of machine learning models with the interpretability and control of multi-factor models. By using [SHAP values](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3295222.3295230) for feature selection, MultiMax trains multi-factor models with the best possible subset of fundamental and technical features.

MultiMax trains multi-factor models using the following algorithm:
```
1. Train a machine learning model to predict stock prices using economic factors.
2. Calculate SHAP values for each prediction of the machine learning model.
3. Sort features by their SHAP value's mean magnitude. Features with a higher magnitude are more important.
4. Perform linear regression on the N most important features, training a multi-factor model.
5. Use the multi-factor model to trade using a value investing strategy.
```

Random forests (RFs), gradient boosting machines (GBMs), and deep neural networks (DNNs) are all available as base models for this construction process.

## Backtesting Results
Constructed models can achieve reasonably high profits with great consistency. DNN-based MultiMax models can even achieve better Sharpe ratios than published multi-factor models, like Fama-French 3-factor and Carhart 4-factor models.

The following results were taken over 5 trials of each model:

| Model             | Type     | Sharpe Ratio | Max. Drawdown (%) | Compounding Annual Return (%) |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------------ | ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Buy and Hold      | Baseline | 0.224	      | 55.50             |	6.150                         |
| Fama-French       | Baseline | 0.606        | 77.10             |	21.26                         |
| **Carhart**       | Baseline | 0.643	      | 75.60	            | **23.12**                     |
| **RF-based MFM**  | Multimax | 0.538	      | **30.54**         | 10.73                         |
| GBM-based MFM     | Multimax | 0.492	      | 39.60	            | 10.18                         |
| **DNN-based MFM** | Multimax | 0.779	      | 39.16	            | 18.90                         |

## Features 
In MultiMax, users can:
- Establish a trading environment with their own dataset and parameters.
- Train a random forest, gradient boosting machine or DNN to predict stock prices with their desired hyperparameters.
- Construct a multi-factor model using their ML modelâ€™s N most important factors.
- Perform backtesting using their multi-factor model with the TopKDrop strategy.
- Save their models as pre-trained trading objects (PTOs) that can be shared and reused for live trading.
- Analyse and visualise the behaviour, accuracy, profitability, and risk of their ML and multi-factor models.

## Usage
Setting up MultiMax is easy: copy all files from the [app directory](./app) into a QuantConnect project!

To run a backtest, open the [main app](./app/main.py) and press the "Play" button. 

![Debug logs for a backtest](/images/run_main.png)
Training output will appear in QuantConnect's debug logs, while the final results will be available as a backtest on your Quantconnect account.

To analyse an existing backtest, open the [results tool](./app/results.ipynb), enter the key of the saved pre-trained trading object (PTO), and press the "Run All" button.
